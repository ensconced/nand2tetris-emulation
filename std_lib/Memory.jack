/*
  Heap allocator using the "Buddy memory algorithm".
  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation
  There is also a good desciption of the algorithm in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming Vol 1.

  The algorithm involves maintaining a number of lists of free blocks. Each list contains
  blocks of a different size. The lists are doubly linked to make it easy to remove a block from any
  position within a list, provided a pointer to the base of the block. Another important aspect
  of the algorithm is that each block (excepting the original single block which covers the entire heap)
  has a "buddy" block. It's easy to find the buddy of any given block, provided a pointer to its base,
  without needing to iterate through any lists at all, just by doing some pointer arithmetic.

  Free blocks have a 4-word header consisting of:
   - a boolean field set to true, indicating that the block is free
   - the forward pointer to the next block
   - the backward pointer to the previous block
   - a field indicating the order of the block

  Allocated blocks only need one field in their header:
   - a boolean field set to false, indicating that the block is not free

  The buddy algorithm works very nicely when your heap begins at memory address 0. Knuth's description
  assumes this is the case. Ours however begins at address 2048, which makes it all slightly more awkward,
  but it still works if we take account of this offset.

  The algorithm has some overheads in terms of memory usage. Specifically, it requires
  13 words of memory, to hold the heads for each of the 13 avail lists. We could
  just use 13 static variables but this would make a significant impact on the space remaining
  in the static segment for usage in user programs. It would also make the code here annoying
  verbose. Another alternative would be to have a dedicated section of system memory for these
  overheads, but it would feel wrong to modify the architecure just to accomodate this algorithm.
  So here I have taken another approach. To start with, I use the screen memory for the overheads.
  Then I initialize the allocator. Then I use the initialized allocator to allocate a block of
  memory to use for its own overheads, and copy the overheads over from screen memory
  into this block. Hence I kind of bootstrap the allocator then use it to allocate some memory
  for itself which is kind of cool. Then I zero out the screen memory again.
  I guess this the the screen might briefly flicker on startup but I don't really care about that.
