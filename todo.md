# Notes Jul '23

Translate game of life into jack code

# optimisations

- don't waste an instruction on zeroes and ones - add new VM command `set` e.g. `set local 1 0`, where the first argument is the offset, as usual, and the second arg is the value, which is restricted to 1, 0 or -1, so that it can be set in a single instruction without needing any pushes or pops
- use `set` instruction whereever possible, e.g. for `let i = 0`
- I think I'm shuffling stuff around r7 or r8 unnecessarily sometimes?
- eliminate unnecessary pushing/popping of return values

- drawRectangle
- create web IO implementation for web debugger?
- make code panels draggable/collapsible?
- do compiling in browser with webapp, using wasm-bindgen to get result with sourcemap - then can use types generated by wasm-bindgen - no need for ts_rs?
- read docs on wasm-bindgen https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/examples/index.html
- "realtime play" - wil require windowing code-panels to improve perf
- show contextual jack node
- include linting and tsc in test suite
- void return values - don't push zero just to pop it again

## perf/code-size optimisations

- identidcal code folding - automatic extraction of subroutines
- use an even smaller font e.g. this 5x5 px one https://www.dafont.com/5x5.font (and caps only?)
- peephole optimisation of vm code

### emulator enhancements

- report stack overflows etc
- add stepping ability
  - step line of jack code
  - step line of vm code
  - step asm instruction

### refactoring

- make error handling and reporting more consistent in parsers
- maybe get rid of clap and parse cli args myself

# TODO

- write full stdlib
- implement vector module
- add SCREEN and GLYPHS variable for use in jack code
- allow use of e.g. var int[4] foo; to declare fixed-length arrays to be allocated in static section, or on stack. this could make the code in Memory.jack much neater
- figure out limits of current algo for two's complement multiplication - is there a simple failing example for a small negative number?
- booth's algo? or...read this: https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~markhill/cs354/Fall2008/beyond354/int.mult.html ?
- check arg count equals param count? might be difficult - would need to look across classes sometimes...

### jack extras

- for loops
- pointers
- rudimentary typechecking? might be tricky...would need to allow some coercions - e.g. obj to int for Memory.dealloc, array to obj for constructors.
- break/continue

### programs

- pong
- mandelbrot
- tetris
- game of life
- asteroids
- snake
- game selector

### hardware

- add timer?
- add another hardware register?
- bitshift - this would be really helpful...
- floating point?
- multiplication / division?
- ethernet...
- graphics: fix flickering by assigning a "don't draw" register which programs can use to flag when frame buffer is in an inconsistent state, and which the computer will read to decide whether or not to actually refresh the screen. will need to figure out how to make this work on the fpga too!
