create snapshots test dir
each subdir contains a Main.jack file and a pbm
write test to read every subdir, execute Main.jack to completion, then check screen against pbm
if no snapshot is present, should write snapshot pbm file
write a load of such tests
remove the other failing tests

- remove auto-initialisation of variables to zero...(I'm sure I'm relying on this somewhere though...l)

# function return optimisation

- further optimise call/return assembly:

  - in returns, sometimes decrementing SP is sufficient - don't need to actually restore anything if you USED it but it's not in the original pointers_to_restore?? - currently we take union of these, but should keep them separate in order to make this optimisation
  - don't waste an instruction on zeroes and ones
  - I think I'm shuffling stuff around r7 or r8 unnecessarily sometimes

- eliminate unnecessary pushing/popping of return values

same of both cases - essentially a call graph

- drawRectangle
- create web IO implementation for web debugger
- make code panels draggable/collapsible
- use test methods for stepping through in emulator?
- use this to debug int printing issue
- do compiling in browser with webapp, using wasm-bindgen to get result with sourcemap - then can use types generated by wasm-bindgen - no need for ts_rs?
- read docs on wasm-bindgen https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/examples/index.html
- "realtime play" - wil require windowing code-panels to improve perf
- show contextual jack node
- include linting and tsc in test suite

## perf/code-size optimisations

- identidcal code folding - automatic extraction of subroutines
- don't unnecessarily zero-out locals in jack code
- use an even smaller font e.g. this 5x5 px one https://www.dafont.com/5x5.font (and caps only?)
- peephole optimisation of vm code

### emulator enhancements

- report stack overflows etc
- add stepping ability
  - step line of jack code
  - step line of vm code
  - step asm instruction

### refactoring

- make error handling and reporting more consistent in parsers
- maybe get rid of clap and parse cli args myself

# TODO

- write full stdlib
- implement vector module
- add SCREEN and GLYPHS variable for use in jack code
- allow use of e.g. var int[4] foo; to declare fixed-length arrays to be allocated in static section, or on stack. this could make the code in Memory.jack much neater
- figure out limits of current algo for two's complement multiplication - is there a simple failing example for a small negative number?
- booth's algo? or...read this: https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~markhill/cs354/Fall2008/beyond354/int.mult.html ?
- check arg count equals param count? might be difficult - would need to look across classes sometimes...

### jack extras

- for loops
- pointers
- rudimentary typechecking? might be tricky...would need to allow some coercions - e.g. obj to int for Memory.dealloc, array to obj for constructors.
- break/continue

### programs

- pong
- mandelbrot
- tetris
- game of life
- asteroids
- snake
- game selector

### hardware

- add timer?
- add another hardware register?
- bitshift - this would be really helpful...
- floating point?
- multiplication / division?
- ethernet...
- graphics: fix flickering by assigning a "don't draw" register which programs can use to flag when frame buffer is in an inconsistent state, and which the computer will read to decide whether or not to actually refresh the screen. will need to figure out how to make this work on the fpga too!
